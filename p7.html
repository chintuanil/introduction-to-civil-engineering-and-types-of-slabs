A dome slab can be used to build a distinctive mosque, temple, or palace dome. A steel support structure is used to sustain this semi-circle concrete structure, and The concrete is reasonably thick. It is meticulously poured into a smooth or textured dome shape utilizing a framework.

<h3>Uses of Dome Slab</h3>
One of the key advantages of the dome-shaped system is its capacity to deliver structural carrying capacities comparable to traditional slabs while using less concrete.

<h3>Advantages of Dome Slab</h3>
<br>
Domes are highly sturdy and long-lasting.<br>
<br>
They are resistant to fire, water, and wind, making them impervious to
 hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, and other natural calamities.<br>
<br>
The Monolithic Dome can be measured in centuries, whereas the normal
 building life is calculated in decades.<br>
<br>
<h3>Disadvantages of Dome Slab</h3>
<br>
Monolithic domes are made of three materials that are not the 
most environmentally friendly.<br>
<br>
Falling trees and vandalism can easily destroy the air form,
 a sensitive membrane. <br>
<br>
If damaged, water could soak into the underlying insulation and 
turn into a giant matted sponge.<br>
<br>
Because of the activities, the monolithic dome provides a
 tight airtight seal, which isnâ€™t always desired.<br>
<br>
Depending on the structure you want to build, a monolithic 
dome may require additional permits.</p>
