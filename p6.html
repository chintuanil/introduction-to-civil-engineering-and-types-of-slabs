A hardy slab is a concrete slab made out of full bricks. Hardy bricks are made up of hollow concrete blocks and are hollow bricks. This type of block is used to fill in gaps in the slab. Hardy slabs lower the quantity of concrete in the slab while also reducing the slabâ€™s weight. Compared to traditional slabs, this one has a thickness of 2.27 m.


<h3>Uses of Hardy Slab<h3>
Where temperatures are high, a hardy slab is used. The thickness of the slab is increased to resist the heat from the top. The heat from the walls is resisted by utilizing thermal-infused unique bricks. Thermal is the best sunlight insulator.

<h3>Advantages of Hardy Slab<h3>
Construction simplicity, particularly when all beams are buried beams.<br>
<br>
Improved sound and heat insulation.<br>
<br>
The slab weight was lowered by reducing the amount of concrete below the
 neutral axis.<br>
<br>
Thermal and acoustic insulation of the highest quality.<br>
<br>
<h3>Disadvantages of Hardy Slab<h3>
The hollow core ribbed brick units may be damaged if not handled
 appropriately during shipping.<br>
<br>
For short periods, it is not cost-effective.<br>
<br>
Repairing and strengthening it is difficult.</p>
