It is a form of slab that is frequently used in bridge construction. Bridges are vulnerable to two loads: movement loads and wind loads. Slabs with arches, also known as arch slabs, are used in places where wind loads must be directed and a lengthy curve in the slab’s direction. It prevents the bridge from collapsing due to high winds.


<h3>Uses of Arch Slab</h3>
An arch is a curving piece used to span an opening and support loads from above in architecture and civil engineering. The vault’s development was built on the foundation of the arch.

<h3>Advantages of Arch Slab</h3>
It has the capability of spanning a longer distance.
It can be made out of nearly any material.
In comparison to other designs, it provides better degrees of resistance.
It gives you a leg up when hauling heavy loads.
Over time, it continues to offer assistance without distorting.
<h3>Disadvantages of Arch Slab</h3>
For an effective span, further side support is required.
It allows you to utilize a finite span length.
It is a building that necessitates meticulous upkeep.
It’s a bridge option that isn’t feasible in some areas.
Completing the job takes a long time.</p>
