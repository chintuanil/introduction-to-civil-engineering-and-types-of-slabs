       <h1>Career in Civil Engineering</h1>
     <p><img src="Civil-Engineer (1).jpg" width="1000" depth="1000">
Civil Engineering involves the design of structures that improve 
the quality of life, such as highways,buildings and bridges.<br> Some of the
 key challenges for engineering in the coming years will be conserving 
the environment, reducing the use of the<br> precious resources of the planet 
and finding ways to avert natural disasters.
Whether you’re thinking about going into Civil<br> Engineering or
 you’re already working in the industry, here are some reasons why
 Civil Engineering is an important ingredient<br> for the economic development
 of the region.</p>

<h3>Civil Engineering is a rewarding career choice</h3>
 <p>Civil engineering is one of the top five in-demand engineering jobs of the 
future and one of the most lucrative career options. </p>

<h3>Civil Engineering is one of the creative career options</h3>
 <p>If you think that creativity can only be found in art, think again!
 The vast number of different designs for bridges, buildings and other
 structures illustrate how civil engineers need to be creative and innovative.</p>
  

<h3>Civil Engineers make the world look beautiful</h3>
 <p>Civil engineers make the world more liveable by building bridges, road,
 airports, homes, hospitals, parks, tunnels, stadiums and pretty much
 everything else one can think of! They strive towards building a developed 
community. </p>

<h3>Civil Engineering promotes team spirit</h3>
 <p>Civil engineering fosters cooperation and team spirit among engineers.
 Engineers work in teams to solve real-world problems, so if you’re a 
team player, it’s the perfect career for you. </p>

<h3>Civil engineering is so diverse</h3>
 <p>Civil engineering encompasses within its fold many job roles, sectors, 
skills, and people from varied fields such as Railway Engineering, Structural 
Mechanics, Geotechnical Engineering, Building Materials, Project Management, 
and Structural Design and Hydraulics. </p>
